      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold text-teal-900 mb-5 animate-zoom-in">What is Open Auto Transport?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Open auto transport is the most popular and budget-friendly method for shipping vehicles across the United States. It involves loading your vehicle onto an open-air carrier, commonly seen on highways, where it is securely fastened for the journey. Unlike enclosed transport, which fully protects vehicles from external elements, open transport exposes cars to weather conditions like rain, sun, or light dust. Despite this, it remains a safe and efficient option for most vehicles, including sedans, SUVs, trucks, and motorcycles.</p>
      <img src="/open-transport-truck.png" alt="Open car carrier on a highway with vehicles" class="w-full rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-5 hover-grow">
      <p class="mb-4">AmeriFreight ensures that their open carriers are operated by insured, experienced professionals, guaranteeing the safety of your vehicle. Open transport is perfect for everyday vehicles that don’t require the premium protection of enclosed trailers, making it a cost-effective choice for short or long-distance moves.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Key benefits of open auto transport include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Open transport is 40-60% less expensive than enclosed transport, ideal for budget-conscious customers.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> With a large network of open carriers, scheduling is quick and flexible, reducing wait times.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Suitable for a wide range of vehicles, from compact cars to larger SUVs and trucks.</li>
        <li><strong>Safety Measures:</strong> Vehicles are securely strapped to prevent movement, ensuring safe delivery even in varying weather conditions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">While open transport may not be ideal for high-value or delicate vehicles, it’s a reliable choice for most car owners. AmeriFreight’s expertise ensures that your vehicle is handled with care, making open transport a practical and dependable option.</p>
